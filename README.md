# redux-scaffold
An npm module to make quick redux components.

Install with

```
npm install -g redux-scaffold 
```

then navigate to the parent directory of where you want the redux component to go (ie: /containers)
then type

```
redux-scaffold 
```

Give your component a name. A new component with some basic redux configuration will be created in the current directory.
